# ELEC5305-SomethingAwesome

Read my project proposal [here](https://github.com/neuromorphic-chair/ELEC5305-SomethingAwesome/blob/2ae51cfacbac4b04b7b85de36b18b35da1c3e449/Reports/ELEC5305_Something_Awesome_Proposal.pdf).

Plan to use the excellent work by [Hguimaraes](https://github.com/Hguimaraes/gtzan.keras) as starting point. I will transition to pytorch instead of keras as the inbuilt functions can simplify many aspects.
